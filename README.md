## **FreeRTOS Architecture Overview**

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Tasks] -- Schedules --> B[Scheduler]
    B -- Runs --> A
    A -- Communicate via --> C[Queues/Semaphores/Mutexes]
    C -- Signals/Protects --> A
    D[ISRs] -- Signal --> C
    E[Timers] -- Callback --> A
    F[Event Groups] -- Sync --> A
    G[Idle Hook] -- Runs when idle --> B
```

- **Tasks:** Independent threads of execution.
- **Scheduler:** Decides which task runs next.
- **Queues/Semaphores/Mutexes:** For communication and synchronization.
- **ISRs:** Interrupt Service Routines, can signal tasks.
- **Timers:** Run code at intervals or after delays.
- **Event Groups:** Synchronize multiple tasks on events.
- **Idle Hook:** Runs when no other tasks are ready.

## **How to Use This Project**

1. **Select a Demo**
   - Open `main/blink_example_main.c`.
   - Uncomment **one** of the `#define RUN_FREERTOS_..._DEMO` lines to choose which demo to run. Only one should be active at a time.

2. **Build and Flash**
   - Use ESP-IDF commands:
     ```sh
     idf.py build
     idf.py -p (PORT) flash monitor
     ```
   - Replace `(PORT)` with your serial port (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `COM3`).

3. **Observe Output**
   - Open the serial monitor to see log messages and interact with the board.

## **Demo Modules and FreeRTOS APIs Explained**

### 1. **Basic FreeRTOS Demo** (`freertos_basic.c/h`)
- **What:** Shows how to create and run multiple FreeRTOS tasks.
- **Why:** Learn task creation, scheduling, and basic multitasking.
- **When:** Use for simple multitasking (e.g., blinking LEDs, periodic actions).
- **Example:** Two tasks blink the same LED at different rates, demonstrating task switching.

### 2. **Intermediate FreeRTOS Demo** (`freertos_intermediate.c/h`)
- **What:** Demonstrates inter-task communication using a queue and ISR.
- **Why:** Safely communicate between an interrupt (button press) and a task.
- **When:** Use when you need to signal a task from an ISR (e.g., button, sensor).
- **Example:** Pressing the BOOT button toggles the LED using a queue.

### 3. **Advanced FreeRTOS Demo** (`freertos_advanced.c/h`)
- **What:** Shows software timers and event groups for advanced synchronization.
- **Why:** Timers allow periodic actions without blocking tasks; event groups synchronize multiple tasks.
- **When:** Use timers for periodic/delayed actions, event groups for multi-task sync.
- **Example:** A timer toggles the LED every second; two tasks wait for the event.

### 4. **Mutex Demo** (`freertos_mutex.c/h`)
- **What:** Mutexes protect shared resources from concurrent access.
- **Why:** Prevents data corruption and race conditions.
- **When:** Use when multiple tasks share a resource (e.g., UART, I2C, SPI).
- **Example:** Two tasks print to UART, using a mutex to avoid mixed output.

### 5. **Recursive Mutex Demo** (`freertos_recursive_mutex.c/h`)
- **What:** Recursive mutexes allow the same task to lock a mutex multiple times.
- **Why:** Useful for nested function calls that need the same lock.
- **When:** Use when a task may need to lock the same resource multiple times in a call chain.
- **Example:** A task locks a recursive mutex in nested functions; another task waits for it.

### 6. **Semaphore Demo** (`freertos_semaphore.c/h`)
- **What:** Semaphores are for signaling (binary) and managing resource pools (counting).
- **Why:** Synchronize tasks or limit access to multiple resources.
- **When:** Use binary semaphores for signaling (e.g., ISR to task), counting for resource pools.
- **Example:** A simulated ISR gives a binary semaphore; a task waits for it. Another task uses a counting semaphore for a pool of resources.

### 7. **Queue Set Demo** (`freertos_queue_set.c/h`)
- **What:** Queue sets let a task wait on multiple queues/semaphores at once.
- **Why:** Efficient for event-driven tasks with multiple sources.
- **When:** Use when a task must wait for messages from several sources.
- **Example:** Two queues send events; one task waits on the set and handles whichever is ready.

### 8. **Stream Buffer Demo** (`freertos_stream_buffer.c/h`)
- **What:** Stream buffers send/receive streams of bytes (not discrete messages).
- **Why:** Useful for UART, audio, or any streaming data.
- **When:** Use for variable-length data transfer between tasks or ISRs.
- **Example:** One task sends strings, another receives and prints them.

### 9. **Message Buffer Demo** (`freertos_message_buffer.c/h`)
- **What:** Message buffers send/receive discrete messages of variable length.
- **Why:** Useful for command passing, packets, or message-based protocols.
- **When:** Use for discrete messages between tasks or ISRs.
- **Example:** One task sends messages, another receives and prints them.

### 10. **Task Notification Demo** (`freertos_task_notify.c/h`)
- **What:** Direct-to-task notifications are fast, lightweight signals built into every task.
- **Why:** Fastest way to signal a task from another task or ISR.
- **When:** Use for simple signaling or counting events between tasks/ISRs.
- **Example:** One task notifies another, which counts and prints notifications.

### 11. **Priority Inheritance Demo** (`freertos_priority_inheritance.c/h`)
- **What:** Priority inheritance boosts the priority of a low-priority task holding a mutex needed by a higher-priority task.
- **Why:** Prevents 'priority inversion' where a high-priority task is blocked by a low-priority one.
- **When:** Use when sharing resources between tasks of different priorities.
- **Example:** Low, medium, and high priority tasks share a mutex; priority inheritance prevents inversion.

### 12. **Dynamic Task Demo** (`freertos_dynamic_task.c/h`)
- **What:** Tasks can be created and deleted dynamically at runtime.
- **Why:** Useful for temporary/background work, or to save memory.
- **When:** Use when a task is only needed for a short time or on demand.
- **Example:** One task creates another, which runs and deletes itself.

### 13. **Idle Hook Demo** (`freertos_idle_hook.c/h`)
- **What:** The idle hook is a function called by the FreeRTOS idle task when no other tasks are runnable.
- **Why:** Useful for background cleanup, power management, or statistics.
- **When:** Use for lowest-priority, non-time-critical work.
- **Example:** Prints a message from the idle hook; runs automatically when system is idle.

## **Troubleshooting Tips**

- **Build errors about missing includes or undefined references:**
  - Make sure you have uncommented only one `#define RUN_FREERTOS_..._DEMO` in `blink_example_main.c`.
  - Ensure all source and header files are present in the `main/` directory.
  - Run `idf.py fullclean` if you see strange build errors.

- **Serial monitor shows no output:**
  - Check your serial port and cable.
  - Make sure the correct port is specified in `idf.py -p (PORT) flash monitor`.
  - Try resetting the board.

- **LED does not blink or respond:**
  - Double-check the GPIO number in `menuconfig` or `sdkconfig`.
  - Make sure the board's LED is connected to the correct pin.
  - For button demos, ensure you are pressing the correct button (usually BOOT/GPIO0).

- **Demo seems to hang or crash:**
  - Check for stack overflow (increase task stack size if needed).
  - Use `idf.py monitor` to check for panic or error messages.

- **Idle hook demo does not print:**
  - Make sure `configUSE_IDLE_HOOK` is enabled in `menuconfig` under FreeRTOS settings.

## **FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)**

**Q: Can I run more than one demo at a time?**
A: No, only one demo should be active at a time. Uncomment only one `#define RUN_FREERTOS_..._DEMO` in `blink_example_main.c`.

**Q: How do I change the LED or button GPIO?**
A: Use `idf.py menuconfig` and look for the "Example Configuration" or edit `sdkconfig` directly for `CONFIG_BLINK_GPIO`.

**Q: How do I add my own task or demo?**
A: Use the provided demos as templates. Create a new `.c/.h` file, add your function, and update `blink_example_main.c` and `CMakeLists.txt`.

**Q: What if I get a stack overflow or memory error?**
A: Increase the stack size for your tasks (the 2048 in `xTaskCreate`). Monitor memory usage with ESP-IDF tools.

**Q: Where can I learn more about FreeRTOS?**
A: See the links in the Learning Resources section below.

**Q: Can I use these demos on other ESP chips?**
A: Yes! Just set the correct target with `idf.py set-target <chip_name>` and check pin assignments.
